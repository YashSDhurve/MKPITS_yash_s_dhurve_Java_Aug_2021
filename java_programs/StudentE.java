//Let's see the simple example of encapsulation that has only one field with its setter and getter methods.

    //A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.
    //It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.

package com.mk;

public class StudentE{

private String name;

//creating setter method for name

public void setName(String name){

this.name=name;

}

//creating getter method for name
